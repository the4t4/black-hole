# Black Hole

Black hole is a two-player game, played on a board consists of n x n fields, which has a black hole at
its center. Each player has n-1 spaceships, which are placed initially in the lower (upper) diagonal of
the board (so the same colored spaceships placed on the same side).

The players take turns moving one of their own spaceships. The black hole interferes with the
navigation system of the spaceships, so they cannot move only one place, but they move until they
reach the edge of the board, the black hole, or an other spaceship. A spaceship cannot jump over an
other one. A player wins, if he manages to move half of his spaceships into the black hole.

Implement this game, and let the board size be selectable (5x5, 7x7, 9x9). The game should recognize
if it is ended, and it has to show in a message box which player won. After this, a new game should
be started automatically.
